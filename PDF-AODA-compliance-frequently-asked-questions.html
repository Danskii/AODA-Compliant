    <h1> Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p></p>
    <h2>What is AODA?</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/05a11#">Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act</a> (AODA) is a law that sets out a process for developing and enforcing accessibility standards.</p>
    <p>Persons with disabilities and industry representatives work together with the government to develop the standards.</p>
    <p>Implementing and enforcing these standards will help us reach our goal of an accessible Ontario by 2025.</p>
    <h2>What is accessibility?</h2>
    <p>Accessibility means access. It refers to the ability for everyone, regardless of disability or special needs, to access, use and benefit from everything within their environment. It is the “degree to which a product, device, service, or environment is available to as many people as possible.” Wikipedia</p>
    <p>Founded on the principles of Universal Design, the goal of accessibility is to create an inclusive society for people with physical, mobility, visual, auditory or cognitive disabilities. This means everyone has equal access to perceive, understand, engage, navigate and interact with all elements of the physical and digital world. </p>
    <p>This includes but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Physical Locations / Built Environments</li>
        <li>Web, Digital, Mobile and other technologies (note: links go to What is Digital Accessibility page</li>
        <li>Transportation & Mobility</li>
        <li>Communication  & Customer Service</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Accessibility standards</h2>
    <p>Accessibility standards are laws that government, businesses, non-profits and public sector organizations must follow to become more accessible.</p>
    <p>They help organizations identify and remove barriers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities in 5 areas of daily life:</p>
    <h3>Customer service standard</h3>
    <p>To help remove barriers for people with disabilities so they can access goods, services or facilities.</p>
    <h3>Information and communications standard</h3>
    <p>To help organizations make their information accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
    <h3>Transportation standard</h3>
    <p>To make it easier for everyone to travel in the province.</p>
    <h3>Employment standard</h3>
    <p>To help make hiring and employee support practices more accessible.</p>
    <h3>Design of public spaces standard</h3>
    <p>To help organizations make new and redeveloped outdoor public areas accessible.</p>
    <h2>What is a PDF</h2>
    <p>PDF stands for the Portable Document Format, used to display documents in an electronic form independent of the software, hardware or operating system they are viewed on. Originally developed by Adobe® Systems as an universally compatible file format based on the PostScript format, it has become an international de-facto standard for exchanging documents and information.</p>
    <p>In 2008, Adobe relinquished control of PDF development to the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) and by this PDF became an “open standard”. The specifications for the current PDF version (1.7) are documented under ISO 32000. ISO is also in charge of updating and developing future versions (for example PDF 2.0 under ISO 3200-2 which is expected to be published in 2015).</p>
    <h3>What is PDF remediation?</h3>
    <p>PDF documents can pose unique accessibility challenges and limit access for individuals with print-disabilities. Generally speaking, it is easier to create an accessible PDF document from Microsoft Word or other word-processing applications rather than fixing the PDF document directly. However, there are often situations in which you must fix the accessibility issues with the PDF document instead of relying on other formats.</p>
    <p>Adobe Acrobat Professional contains accessibility and remediation tools to fix PDF documents and check for basic accessibility features. To open the Accessibility tools in Adobe Acrobat DC, go to View > Tools > Accessibility. Adobe has provided additional information for remediating PDF documents with Acrobat DC.</p>
